- You report to the Head of Engineering and you were tasked to prepare a PoC for migration of Adios.ai infrastructure from Heroku to AWS using EKS

## The task
This repository contains a simple web-server application written in Python using [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) framework. The application contains `/users` `GET` endpoint returning all records from `Users` table and `/upload` `POST` endpoint to upload files to S3 bucket

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/users

[
  {
    "email": "alice@example.com",

    "name": "Alice"
  },
  {
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Bob"
  }
]
```

3. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
4. Provide a detailed README file that includes:
   1. Setup and deployment instructions.
